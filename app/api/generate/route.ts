# Timestamp Generation Guidelines v4.0

**IMPORTANT VIDEO LENGTH CONSTRAINT: ${videoEndTimeInfo}**

These instructions are designed to generate a comprehensive, yet scannable, set of timestamps from a video transcript, especially for longer formats like livestreams. The goal is to capture not just major topics, but also specific demonstrations, key insights, and memorable moments that provide maximum value to the viewer.

### Core Principles

1. **Content-Density Over Fixed Numbers:** The number of timestamps should reflect the density of the content, not a fixed count. As a general guideline, aim for **one key moment every 5-10 minutes**, but be flexible. A dense 10-minute segment might need two timestamps, while a 15-minute casual chat might only need one.
2. **Capture Value, Not Just Topics:** The best timestamps point to specific, valuable information. A viewer should be able to look at the list and immediately find a pro-tip, a deep-dive, or a specific answer.
3. **Be Specific and Action-Oriented:** Descriptions should be concise (3-6 words) and clearly state what is happening. Use action verbs to convey activity and learning.

### Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Initial Analysis

- Determine the total video duration from the final timestamp in the transcript. The video length is ${maxTimestamp}. Do not generate any timestamps beyond ${maxTimestamp} under any circumstances.
- Quickly read through the transcript to get a high-level sense of the main themes and the overall flow of the session.

### Step 2: Identify Key Moments

Scan the transcript for the following types of content. This goes beyond simple topic changes and is the key to creating a rich, useful list.

- **The Hook:** Always create a \`00:00:00\` timestamp that uses the first few impactful words of the video.
- **Major Topic Shifts:** The most obvious markers, such as moving from a news update to a personal project demo.
- **Specific Feature Demonstrations:** Pinpoint the exact moment a feature is shown and explained.
    - *Example:* "How to integrate Claude Code into Cursor"
- **"Pro-Tip" or "Nugget" Segments:** Isolate moments where a specific, non-obvious piece of advice is given that could save a viewer time or trouble.
    - *Example:* "Pro-tip for Stripe integration (the 'closed-loop' problem)"
- **Workflow Deep Dives:** Capture segments dedicated to explaining *how* the host accomplishes a complex task from start to finish.
    - *Example:* "Detailing his advanced Claude Code workflow"
- **Live Discoveries or "Aha!" Moments:** If the host discovers a new feature or has a moment of realization live on stream, capture it. It adds personality and is often highly engaging.
    - *Example:* "Discovering the Magic UI Command Palette"
- **Community & Meta Moments:** Acknowledge significant interactions with the community or milestones reached during the stream.
    - *Example:* "The MLX transcriber repo hits 420 stars"
- **Philosophical or "Soapbox" Segments:** If the host takes a moment to share their broader thoughts on a topic, it's a distinct content block worth timestamping.
    - *Example:* "His birthday 'preach' on AI engineering"

### Step 3: Draft Timestamps and Descriptions

- For each identified moment, note the \`HH:MM:SS\` where it begins.
- Write a concise, specific, and action-oriented description (3-6 words).
    - **Good:** "Explaining the new Cursor pricing tiers"
    - **Avoid:** "Talks about pricing"
    - **Good:** "Final walkthrough of Claude Code setup in Cursor"
    - **Avoid:** "Claude Code"
- Use parentheses to add clarifying context where needed (e.g., \`(the 'closed-loop' problem)\`).

### Step 4: Format and Review

1. Assemble the final list in chronological order.
2. Use the standard format:
    
    \`\`\`markdown
    ðŸ•’ Key moments:
    00:00:00 [Initial 3-5 word hook]
    HH:MM:SS [Specific, action-oriented description]
    HH:MM:SS [Specific, action-oriented description]
    ...
    \`\`\`
    
3. Read the entire list from top to bottom. Does it tell the story of the video? Is it easy to scan? Ensure the timestamps are accurate and the descriptions are valuable. Adjust wording for clarity and impact.

### Gold Standard Example

This is the target quality and format for the final output:

\`\`\`
